		<center><h1>The R52</h1></center>


		<p>The R52 is my first ever thinkpad. I've got it from a local second-hand seller. It's in good condition, but without a charger. Also the ultrabay came empty and the ram-cover is missing. Some screws are missing but I found the official manual. It should work with a charger, atleast this is what the seller said. There were some photos so I think it's legit. I plan to buy a charger before anything else. Then a battery for the ultrabay or the ram-cover, I'm not sure yet. It'll run Arch (btw). It's rather old so I won't try to install a bloated desktop enviroment just a wm.</p>
		<p>The Specs: <ul>
		    <li>Pentium M 1.6 Ghz, upgradable not soldered</li>
		    <li>2GB of DDR2 Ram, max. amount</li>
		    <li>14 inch Display</li>
		    <li>The nice keyboard with trackpoint and a trackpad.</li></ul></p>
		<p>Photos go here.</p>
